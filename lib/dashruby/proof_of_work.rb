  # Proof of work is specified using several terms.
  # 1. `target` is big unsigned integer derived from 256-bit hash (interpreted as little-endian integer).
  #     Hash of a valid block should be below target.
  # 2. `bits` is a 'duff compact' representation of a target as uint32.
  # 3. `difficulty` is a floating point multiple of the minimum difficulty.
  #     Difficulty = 2 means the block is 2x more difficult than the minimal difficulty.

    # Note on Satoshi Compact format (used for 'bits' value).
    #
    # The "compact" format is a representation of a whole
    # number N using an unsigned 32bit number similar to a
    # floating point format.
    # The most significant 8 bits are the unsigned exponent of base 256.
    # This exponent can be thought of as "number of bytes of N".
    # The lower 23 bits are the mantissa.
    # Bit number 24 (0x800000) represents the sign of N.
    # N = (-1^sign) * mantissa * 256^(exponent-3)
    #
    # Satoshi's original implementation used BN_bn2mpi() and BN_mpi2bn().
    # MPI uses the most significant bit of the first byte as sign.
    # Thus 0x1234560000 is compact (0x05123456)
    # and  0xc0de000000 is compact (0x0600c0de)
    # (0x05c0de00) would be -0x40de000000
